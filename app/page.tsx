        <p>         
          I'm a recent graduate from the University of Central Florida's Burnett Honors College with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. 
          I'm now actively seeking opportunities as a Software Engineer or Machine Learning Engineer. 
          I'm eager to join a team where I can contribute to impactful projects and learn from experienced pros. 
          I love coding, especially with Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, and C, and I'm always trying out new libraries and frameworks. 
          In my free time, you can find me tinkering and learning more about computer vision and natural language processing.
